# Flight-Fare Prediction

Flight ticket prices can be something hard to guess, today we might see a price, check out the price of the same flight tomorrow, it will be a different story. We might have often heard travelers saying that flight ticket prices are so unpredictable. As data scientists, we are gonna prove that given the right data anything can be predicted. Here you will be provided with prices of flight tickets for various airlines between the months of March and June of 2019 and between various cities. 

Implementation:

i. Created a model that estimates Flight Prices to help users look for best prices when booking flight tickets.

ii. Processed attributes from the Departure Time, Date of Journey, to quantify the data and make it more understandable.

iii. Optimized multiple Regression models using RandomGridsearchCV to reach the best model.

iv. Built a client facing API using flask

v. Deployed app on AWS cloud server.
